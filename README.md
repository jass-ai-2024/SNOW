### Overview
A self-service file system interface that enables users to upload, automatically structure, and search through documents using advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities. The system combines semantic search with agent-based analysis to provide intelligent document organization and retrieval.

###  Problem Statement (technology perspective)
- Data Scientists across different departments implement similar RAG pipelines for different data sets
- Manual document organization is time-consuming and inconsistent
- Lack of standardized approach to document structuring and retrieval
- Need for intelligent search capabilities beyond keyword matching
- Complexity in maintaining multiple separate RAG implementations

### Objectives
- Information processing algorithm
- Knowledge graph creation pipeline 
- Tool integration

### Features
- Feature 1: Cross Document Linkage Detection
- Feature 2: Knowledge graph view
- Feature 3: Template RAG agent over knowledge base
- Feature 4: UI for knowledge base

### Timeline
